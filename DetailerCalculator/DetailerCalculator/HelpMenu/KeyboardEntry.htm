<h2>Using the Keyboard</h2>
<p>The numberpad on the keyboard is used to enter text into the textbox on the left. Pressing enter puts that number into the output window on the right.</p>

<img src="Pictures/Enter_Text.png" alt="number entered in textbox" /><br /><br />
<img src = "Pictures/After_Enter_Pressed.png" alt = "number in output window" />

<p>Pressing the enter key when the textbox on the left is empty will duplicate that last number in the stack.</p>
<img src = "Pictures/Enter_Pressed_Again.png" alt = "two numbers in output window" />

<p>If you press any of the basic operators on the numberpad on the keyboard (+, -, *, and /), then the last two numbers in the stack will be used for the calculations.</p>
<p>The order of the numbers used for the math is exactly as you'd expect. The top number is the first number in an equation, the bottom number is the second. See below for an example:</p>

<img src="Pictures/Minus_Key.png" alt= "minus key about to be entered" />

<p>After pressing the minus key:</p>

<img src = "Pictures/Difference_is_3.png" alt = "answer is 3" />

<p>If the numbers were reversed:</p>
<img src = "Pictures/6_and_3.png" alt = "6 and 3" /><br /><br />
<img src = "Pictures/3_minus_6.png" alt = "diff of 3 minus 6" />

<p>Pressing the Escape key clears the currently entered text.</p>
<p>Pressing the Delete key drops the last number entered.</p>
