<h2>Math Functions</h2>
<p>This calculator will perform basic math functions, just as any other calculator. The input process is very different from a standard calculator, if you're not used to using a reverse-polar notation calculator. In order for any functions to work, you have to have a number entered into the stack (enter a number and press enter). Then, you have to enter a second number and add it to the stack. After you have two numbers in the stack, you can perform the four basic math functions. The bottom number is the first number of the operation; the number above is the second.</p>

<p>For instance, if you input numbers as follows:</p>

<p>You can subtract using Keyboard Input or the buttons on the left. In this case, 3 will be subtracted from 6, leaving 3. If the numbers were reversed, you'd get a -3.</p>

<p>All of the basic math functions respond to the buttons or keyboard entry on the numberpad only (Currently, functions from the main keyboard are not supported.)</p>

<p>Please note that text has to be entered into the stack (not the entry box) in order for the calculator to recognize the input and perform the math.</p>
