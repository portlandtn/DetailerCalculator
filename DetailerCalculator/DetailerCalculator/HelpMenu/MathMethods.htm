<h2>Math Methods</h2>
<p>There are two methods of math available for this calculator: Detailing and Standard.</p>
<img src="Pictures/MathMethods.png" alt="Math Methods" />

<h3>Standard Method</h3>
<p>The standard method is very straight forward. Enter a number like 2.08 and another number like 2.09, and you will get the answer 4.17 if you add them together. Detailing math is very different, however. Decimals are used to represent different numbers (see Detailing Method).</p>

<h3>Detailing Method</h3>
<p>Detailers use decimals with four rounded decimal places to represent feet, inches, and sixteenths of an inch. If you enter 2.0000 on the calculator, it equates to 2'-0". If you enter 2.08, the calculator recognizes the input as 2'-8" (provided the Detailing Method radio box is checked). A number like 2.0804 is equal to 2'-8 4/16" (or 2'-8 1/4" reduced).</p>

<p>Numbers in this format make it easier for architectural math to be done quickly. When using this method and adding 2.08 and 2.08, your answer would be 5.04 (5'-4") instead of 4.16.</p>
