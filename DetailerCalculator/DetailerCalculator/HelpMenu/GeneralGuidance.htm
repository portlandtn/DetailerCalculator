<h2>General Guidance</h2>
<p>This calculator functions similarly to the HP48G calculator. It uses reverse-polar notation. For instance, you can't simply type in a number, hit the '+' sign, type another number, and then press 'Enter.' The text box will clear out. </p>
<p>You have to enter a number in the textbox on the left, and press enter to add it to the stack. Then, another number can be entered. Pressing one of the buttons or the operators on the number pad will do basic math functions on the last two numbers in the stack.</p>
<p>Feel free to explor the options on the left to get a more in-depth explanation of how the calculator works.</p>
