    <h2>Trig Functions</h2>
    <p>A key part of this calculator is the ability to do some basic trig quickly.</p>

    <h3>Slope</h3>
    <p>You'll notice on the right side that there is a box for 'slope' input. This number is a representation of inches of rise over 12 inches of run. Often times, the detailers are given a roof slope with this format.</p>

    <p>Entering a number in this box will automatically calculate the angle in the lower box. Simply click Overwrite to overwrite the selected angle on the right.</p>

    <p>You also have the option of manually entering any angle and storing that angle instead.</p>

    <p>You can store up to four different angles.</p>

    <h3>General Trig Functions</h3>
    <img src= "Pictures/TrigFunctions.png" alt="Six trig buttons" /><br/>
    <p>On the left of the calculator there are six buttons that perform the six basic conversions on a triangle.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>B to R = Base to Rise</li>
        <li>B to S = Base to Slope</li>
        <li>S to B = Slope to Base</li>
        <li>S to R = Slope to Rise</li>
        <li>R to S = Rise to Slope</li>
        <li>R to B = Rise to Base</li>
    </ul>
    <p>On a triangle, there are three sides. When dealing in construction, there is a naming convention used: rise, base, and slope.</p>

    <p>Given an angle (often determined by the roof slope), any side can be determined when you know another side's dimension.</p>
    
    <h3>Base Rise to Angle</h3>
    <p>You'll notice a section to the left that shows blank Base and Rise textboxes. There are times a detailer has to determine the angle without the conventional "on 12" roof slope. Sometimes, only the rise and the base dimensions are known. In these cases, you can fill out this information to set a custom angle.</p>

    <p>When you type in the dimensions, the angle is automatically filled out. You can overwrite any angle with the overwrite button.</p>
