<h2>Output Window</h2>
<p>The output window is the section at the bottom-right of the calculator. It shows you what the numbers are in the stack and the result of various math applied to them.</p>

<img src = "Pictures/OutputWindow.png" alt = "Output Window" />

<p>This window stores a preset number of values, and the oldest number is removed from the stack once it exceeds that number.</p>

<p>You cannot modify any of the numbers in the stack directly. You can remove the numbers using the 'Drop' or 'Clear All' buttons, or you can perform various math and trig functions.</p>
